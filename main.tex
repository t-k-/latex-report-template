\section*{Summer Plan - Wei} % Major section

\begin{itemize}
	\item Effectiveness
		\begin{itemize}
		\item wildcards support under new model [2 weeks]
		\item evaluation NTCIR-12 wildcard [3 days, may find technical issues to fix]
		\item explore methods to index operator symbols [2 days]
		\item operator similarity awareness retrieval [2 weeks, require new index schema]
		\item evaluation on new system with operator awareness [1 day]
		\end{itemize}
	\item Efficiency (Make system demo appealing to others) 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item rewrite posting list to make it more generic, so that it can handle math posting. [1 week]
		\item enable math posting list caching (put into memory, real search engine all do this, will boost the performance very much) [3 days]
		\item in-memory compression (good for publishing paper on compressing math posting list) [1 week]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This can both reduce indexing time and query run time
		\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Code readability (Make others willing to build new idea on top of our code)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Preprocessor (put declarations in .c files, no need to edit .h files, create a nice foundation to rewrite some messy part of the code, make other people easy to add things)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item support foreach to reduce callback functions in codebase [1 day, already implemented a prototype]
				\item string, dictionary utilities to make code much more clean. [3 days]
				\item support header file generation and automatic header dependency resolution. [3 days]
				\item apply preprocessor to current code frame. [1 day, write makefile rules]
				\item Later gradually rewrite badly-written components. [future research]
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item Documentation: Document on how to configure, generate results and evaluate scores under new model (many new steps added on original Approach0). Publish the document on the Internet. [1 day]
\end{itemize}

Preferred focus order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Code readability [Preprocessor would not take too much time, it is worth investing]
\item Documentation
\item Effectiveness 
\item Efficiency 
\end{enumerate}
